\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing data from a random, fully crossed two-facet design. Must have one or more columns for metrics of interest, one column for labeling subjects, and two columns for labeling facets.}

\item{col.scores}{The name of the column containing the metric of interest (i.e. scores, readings, etc.). Enter as a string.}

\item{col.subjects}{The name of the column containing the labels for the subjects. Enter as a string.}

\item{col.facet1}{The name of the column containing the labels for the first facet. Enter as a string.}

\item{col.facet2}{The name of the column containing the labels for the second facet. Enter as a string.}

\item{seq1}{A sequence of integers defining the interval at which to test the first facet. Enter a vector, or use the seq() function directly.}

\item{seq2}{A sequence of integers defining the interval at which to test the second facet. Enter a vector, or use the seq() function directly.}

\item{threshold}{A decimal between 0 and 1. Will be used to calculate the probability of the reliability coefficient being above the inputted threshold. 0.7 by default.}

\item{rounded}{The number of decimal places the reliability coefficients and probabilities should be rounded to. 3 by default.}

\item{probs}{A list containing two quantiles (between 0 and 1) at which to evaluate the reliability coefficients. Set to c(0.025, 0.975) by default.}

\item{prior}{An optional set of prior distributions for the variance components, specified by the user through the set_prior() function in brms. To ensure correctly formatted priors, the user should first use the get_prior() function with the formula "col.scores ~ (1|col.subjects) + (1|col.facet1) + (1|col.facet2) + (1|col.subjects:col.facet1) + (1|col.subjects:col.facet2) + (1|col.facet1:col.facet2)". Type ?brms::set_prior in the console for more information. NULL by default.}

\item{warmup}{Number of iterations to use per chain as the burn-in period for MCMC sampling. 2000 by default.}

\item{iter}{Number of total iterations per chain (including warmup). 5000 by default.}

\item{chains}{Number of Markov chains. 4 by default.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to use when executing chains in parallel. 4 by default.}

\item{adapt_delta}{A value between 0 and 1. A larger value slows down the sampler but decreases the number of divergent transitions. 0.995 by default.}

\item{max_treedepth}{Sets the maximum tree depth in the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Set to 15 by default, but can be increased if tree depth is exceeded.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the sequence of values to be tested for facet 1 and facet 2, the lower and upper quantiles of the reliability coefficient specified by the user, the median of the reliability coefficient, and the probability of the coefficient being above the inputted threshold.
